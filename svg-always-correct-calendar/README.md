# svg-always-correct-calendar

Taken from [https://github.com/edent/Dynamic-SVG-Calendar-Icon](https://github.com/edent/Dynamic-SVG-Calendar-Icon)

This is using js under the hood so if the website is really secure, the svg shouln't be correct.

> the version here is a bit modified to simulate XSS

## Usage

```html
<img src="date.svg"/>
```
